# Multiple-Linear-Regression

This is a Multiple Linear Regression Model in python using the python's machine learning library. The model plots a straight line after being trained on a training set and its performance is evaluated for a testing set. It is different from Simple Linear Regression in terms of the number of input features. It consists of multiple input features whereas the Simple Linear Regression takes only a single input feature.

Requirements: 1) Python 2.7+ Required python libraries: 1) numpy 2) matplotlib 3) pandas 4) sklearn

The python implementation uses the sklearn library to build a regression model which is trained with the training set. 

Before using the dataset, the data preprocessing is done.
